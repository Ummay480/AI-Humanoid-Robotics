# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 1 Fundamentals

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Feature**: [Chapter 1 Fundamentals Specification](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification written for educators, students, and practitioners. Clear user scenarios provided. No framework-specific implementation details included.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 15 lessons have specific, testable learning objectives. Success criteria include both content metrics and production readiness metrics. Scope clearly bounded to fundamentals; advanced topics deferred.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. All 15 lessons have defined learning objectives and content requirements.

## Final Status

✅ **APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the `/sp.plan` command to generate detailed implementation plan.
