# Tasks: Perception and Sensors Module

## User Input
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary
Generated comprehensive task list for the perception and sensors module implementation, organized by user story priority. The tasks include setup, foundational components, and implementation of all three user stories (sensor acquisition, computer vision, and sensor fusion) with specific file paths and dependencies.

## Implementation Details
The task list includes:
- 50+ specific implementation tasks organized by phase and user story
- Clear file paths for each component to be implemented
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Dependencies mapped between tasks
- Independent test criteria for each user story
- MVP approach starting with User Story 1

## Validation
- All tasks follow the required checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- Tasks organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3)
- Foundational components identified that block multiple user stories
- Parallel execution opportunities documented
- Each user story is designed to be independently testable
