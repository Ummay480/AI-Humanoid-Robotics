This section covers the fundamental theory behind Transformer Models.

```python
# Example code
import numpy as np

# Placeholder for implementation
def example_function():
    """Example function for Transformer Models."""
    pass
```

### Concept 2: Implementation Details

Practical implementation considerations for Transformer Models.

```cpp
// C++ Example
#include <iostream>

// Placeholder implementation
void exampleFunction() {
    // Implementation here
}
```
