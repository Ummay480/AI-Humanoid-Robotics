# Lesson 04: Semantic Segmentation

## Chapter Context

This lesson is part of **Chapter 5: Vision**

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of Semantic Segmentation
- Apply these concepts to real-world robotics problems
- Implement solutions using provided code examples

## Introduction

Semantic Segmentation is a fundamental concept in robotics and humanoid systems. This lesson introduces the key ideas and provides practical examples.

## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Core Theory

This section covers the fundamental theory behind Semantic Segmentation.

```python
# Example code
import numpy as np

# Placeholder for implementation
def example_function():
    """Example function for Semantic Segmentation."""
    pass
```

### Concept 2: Implementation Details

Practical implementation considerations for Semantic Segmentation.

```cpp
// C++ Example
#include <iostream>

// Placeholder implementation
void exampleFunction() {
    // Implementation here
}
```

## Labs and Exercises

### Lab 1: Implementation

**Objective**: Implement a basic version of Semantic Segmentation

**Instructions**:
1. Start with the template code provided
2. Implement the required functionality
3. Test your implementation
4. Compare results with expected outputs

## Review Questions

1. What is the definition of Semantic Segmentation?
2. How is Semantic Segmentation applied in practice?
3. What are the limitations of Semantic Segmentation?

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson:
1. Try the interactive lab exercises
2. Ask the ChatKit chatbot for clarification
3. Move to the next lesson
4. Check out related chapters
