## Introduction

Gait Analysis is a fundamental concept in robotics and humanoid systems. This lesson introduces the key ideas and provides practical examples.

## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Core Theory

This section covers the fundamental theory behind Gait Analysis.

```python
# Example code
import numpy as np

# Placeholder for implementation
def example_function():
    """Example function for Gait Analysis."""
    pass
```

### Concept 2: Implementation Details

Practical implementation considerations for Gait Analysis.

```cpp
// C++ Example
#include <iostream>

// Placeholder implementation
void exampleFunction() {
    // Implementation here
}
```
