## Chapter Context

This lesson is part of **Chapter 9: HRI**

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of Safety and Compliance
- Apply these concepts to real-world robotics problems
- Implement solutions using provided code examples

## Introduction

Safety and Compliance is a fundamental concept in robotics and humanoid systems. This lesson introduces the key ideas and provides practical examples.

## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Core Theory

This section covers the fundamental theory behind Safety and Compliance.

```python
# Example code
import numpy as np

# Placeholder for implementation
def example_function():
    """Example function for Safety and Compliance."""
    pass
```

### Concept 2: Implementation Details

Practical implementation considerations for Safety and Compliance.

```cpp
// C++ Example
#include <iostream>

// Placeholder implementation
void exampleFunction() {
    // Implementation here
}
```
