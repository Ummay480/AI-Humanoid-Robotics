## Chapter Context

This lesson is part of **Chapter 9: HRI**

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of Learning from Demonstration
- Apply these concepts to real-world robotics problems
- Implement solutions using provided code examples

## Introduction

Learning from Demonstration is a fundamental concept in robotics and humanoid systems. This lesson introduces the key ideas and provides practical examples.

## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Core Theory

This section covers the fundamental theory behind Learning from Demonstration.

```python
# Example code
import numpy as np

# Placeholder for implementation
def example_function():
    """Example function for Learning from Demonstration."""
    pass
```

### Concept 2: Implementation Details

Practical implementation considerations for Learning from Demonstration.

```cpp
// C++ Example
#include <iostream>

// Placeholder implementation
void exampleFunction() {
    // Implementation here
}
```
