# Lesson 15: Planning Applications

## Chapter Context

This lesson is part of **Chapter 6: Motion Planning**

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of Planning Applications
- Apply these concepts to real-world robotics problems
- Implement solutions using provided code examples

## Introduction

Planning Applications is a fundamental concept in robotics and humanoid systems. This lesson introduces the key ideas and provides practical examples.

## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Core Theory

This section covers the fundamental theory behind Planning Applications.

```python
# Example code
import numpy as np

# Placeholder for implementation
def example_function():
    """Example function for Planning Applications."""
    pass
```

### Concept 2: Implementation Details

Practical implementation considerations for Planning Applications.

```cpp
// C++ Example
#include <iostream>

// Placeholder implementation
void exampleFunction() {
    // Implementation here
}
```
