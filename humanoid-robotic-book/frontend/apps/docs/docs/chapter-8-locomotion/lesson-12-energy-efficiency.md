## Introduction

Energy Efficiency is a fundamental concept in robotics and humanoid systems. This lesson introduces the key ideas and provides practical examples.

## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Core Theory

This section covers the fundamental theory behind Energy Efficiency.

```python
# Example code
import numpy as np

# Placeholder for implementation
def example_function():
    """Example function for Energy Efficiency."""
    pass
```

### Concept 2: Implementation Details

Practical implementation considerations for Energy Efficiency.

```cpp
// C++ Example
#include <iostream>

// Placeholder implementation
void exampleFunction() {
    // Implementation here
}
```
